## 🌾 Pitch

**SoilSense** is an innovative agri-tech platform designed to empower farmers, researchers, and agricultural enthusiasts with real-time soil data and insights.  
By integrating **IoT-based soil sensors**, **AI-driven analytics**, and an intuitive web interface, SoilSense helps users monitor soil moisture, pH levels, and temperature — ensuring smarter, data-informed agricultural decisions.

🌍 **Mission:** To revolutionize sustainable agriculture through data and digital precision.

💡 **Why it matters:**  
Unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and inefficient resource use challenge modern farming. SoilSense bridges this gap by making soil intelligence accessible to everyone — from smallholder farmers to large agricultural enterprises.
